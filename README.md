# ATV Quad Power Racing 2: PC rewrite

A from-scratch PC version of the 2003 Xbox game, written in Rust with Bevy.
**No game data is included or distributed.** Everything is loaded at runtime
from the player's own copy of the game: the Xbox disc image (`.iso`/`.bin`)
or a folder the disc was extracted to.

## Crates

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `atv-formats` | Engine-free readers: Xbox disc filesystem, "Bark" archive + LZSS, BOG textures (DXT1/DXT5, swizzled ARGB, 8-bit palettized), ROM 1.26 models (meshes + Bezier patches), ROW 2.25 track worlds. |
| `atv-sim` | Engine-free vehicle physics ported from the original game (see `docs/physics.md`): reads the game's `.params` tuning files, spring-strut wheels, body-level ground forces, auto gearbox, wheelies, preload jumps, air control, and track collision built from the track's meshes and patches. |
| `atv-tool` | Command line: `list`, `extract <dir>`, `check` (parses every texture, model and track), `sim` (headless autopilot lap test). |
| `atv-game` | The game (binary `atv2`): a drivable quad on any track, chase camera, keyboard and gamepad input, HUD. |

## Running

```
# Point at your own disc image (or extracted folder)
export ATV2_GAME="/path/to/ATV Quad Power Racing 2.bin"

cargo run --release -p atv-tool -- check
cargo run --release -p atv-game -- --track Dunes1 --quad Bandit
cargo run --release -p atv-tool -- sim --track Dunes1 --quad Bandit --seconds 120
```

| Action | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Throttle | W / Up | RT or A |
| Brake / reverse | S / Down | LT or X |
| Steer | A / D | Left stick |
| Lean back / forward | I / K | Left stick up/down |
| Jump (preload) | Space | RB or B |
| Respot | R | |
| Restart | Backspace | |

The quad respots automatically when it is upside down or falls off the world.
Other options: `--autodrive` (autopilot chases checkpoints), `--camera
x,y,z,tx,ty,tz` (free-fly camera in game coordinates: WASD, Q/E, Shift, right
mouse to look), `--screenshot out.png --after 8` (saves a frame and exits).

Tracks: Dunes1-3, Forest1-3, Glacier1-3, Industrial1-3, Swamp1-3, Stadium1-2.
Quads: ATC, Bandit, Blaze, Bullet, Challenger, Charger, Dimension, Nitro,
Rocket, Skyline, Storm.

Linux build dependencies: `libasound2-dev libudev-dev libxkbcommon-dev
libwayland-dev` (standard Bevy requirements).

## Format notes

See `docs/formats.md` for everything reverse-engineered so far, including
what is still unknown.
